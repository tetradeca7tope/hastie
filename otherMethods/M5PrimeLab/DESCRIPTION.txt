Description:
	M5PrimeLab is a Matlab/Octave toolbox for building regression trees and
	model trees using M5' method. The toolbox allows building trees, testing
	them on separate test sets or using k-fold Cross-Validation, using them
	for prediction, outputting them in a user-readable way etc. M5PrimeLab
	accepts input variables to be continuous, binary, and categorical, as
	well as manages missing values. 
	The source code is tested under Matlab version 7.1 (R14SP3) and
	Matlab version 8.5 (R2015a).

Installation (for Matlab):
	Copy the M5PrimeLab folder into the MATLAB_DIR/toolbox directory
	(where MATLAB_DIR indicates your Matlab installation directory).
	Start Matlab and select "Set path..." from the File menu. Click
	"Add folder..." button and select the folder
	MATLAB_DIR/toolbox/M5PrimeLab in the file dialog. Subsequently,
	press the Save button in order to save your changes to the Matlab
	search path. The toolbox is now installed. Have fun.
