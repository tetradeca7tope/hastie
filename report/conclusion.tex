\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The method proposed seems promising.
Going forward we wish to perform comparisons with other nonparametric regression
methods such as Gaussian process regression, locally polynomial regression and
other additive models \citep{hastie90gam, ravikumar09spam,
duvenaud11additivegps} on other synthetic and real datasets.
One challenge will be in scaling this to large datasets as we need to construct
several $n\times n$ kernel matrices. We wish to explore some ideas on this front
too.
