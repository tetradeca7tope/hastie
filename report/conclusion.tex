\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Our initial results using the proposed method is fairly promising.
Going forward we wish to perform comparisons with other nonparametric regression
methods such as Gaussian process regression, locally polynomial regression and
other additive models \citep{hastie90gam, ravikumar09spam,
duvenaud11additivegps} on other synthetic and real datasets.

Because we hope to apply the proposed method to high-dimensional problems,
we are especially interested in making the proposed method scalable for large $M$. 
A safe screening method \citep{group-lasso-screening:2013} was recently developed 
for the group lasso problem. We hope to adapt this method to our problem, which
could potentially lead to large speedup since for high-dimensional problems
only a small fraction of the $M$ groups will be chosen as non-zero.
%Recent work \citep{group-fused-lasso:2014} on the group fused lasso 
%has sidestepped the $\ell_{1,2}$-norm penalty, transforming it to a 
%smooth objective with non-negativity constraint.
