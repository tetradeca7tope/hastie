Hey, Let's use the following notation in our writeups and code ?

The first primal objective is,
\[
F_1(\aalpha) = \frac{1}{2n} \|Y - \sum_{j=1}^M \KKj \alphaj \|_2^2 
  + \frac{\lambda}{M} \sum_{j=1}^M \sqrt{\alphaj^\top \KKj \alphaj}
\]

Let the Cholesky decomposition of $\KKj$ be, $\KKj = \LLj \LLj^\top$ where
$\LLj$ is lower triangular\footnote{Matlab's \texttt{chol} gives the upper triangular
matrix, but my wrapper \texttt{stableCholesky} takes care of it. It also,
takes care of numerical issues in PSD matrices but be careful when using a
non-PSD matrix with it.}. Let  $\beta_j =  \LLjt \alphaj$. Then, we can write
the above objective as,
\[
F_2(\bbeta) = \frac{1}{2n}\|Y - \sum_{j=1}^M \LLj \alphaj\|_2^2 +
  \frac{\lambda}{M}\sum_{j=1}^M \|\betaj\|_2
\]
Lets call this the second primal objective.


\section*{Coding}

Lets use the following standards, its basically what we are using right now.
\begin{itemize}
\item Maintain $\aalpha$ as an $\RR^{n\times M}$ matrix. Each column corresponds
to an $\alphaj$.
\item Maintain all the Kernel matrices in a $\RR^{n\times n\times M}$ tensor
\texttt{K}, where \texttt{K(:,:,j)} is $\KKj$.
\item Same for all the $\LLj$'s.
\end{itemize}
