% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was
% created by Lise Getoor and Tobias Scheffer, it was slightly modified  
% from the 2010 version by Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, 
% slightly modified from the 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and 
% Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is slightly modified from 
% Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a lightly 
% changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew Moore, 
% which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and 
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
